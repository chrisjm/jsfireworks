There are eight different kinds of shells. They randomly fire off in an infinite loop.

## Interaction

* Click anywhere for a firework to explode at that mouse position.
* Click and drag for a stream of fireworks to explode. Note that the animation may lag with several fireworks on screen.
* Press the spacebar to pause the fireworks.
* Press `s` to mute the sound effects.

## Acknowledgements

This was made/modified for fun during New Years Eve 2020.

It started with watching The Coding Train's coding challenge (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKeyIbT3vXI)). Then I found [@andrewdcampbell's implementation](https://github.com/andrewdcampbell/jsfireworks). Andrew used The Coding Train and Lars Gottlieb's sketch (demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secondstep.dk%2Fp5doodles%2Ffireworks%2F&event=comments&redir_token=RTHX3yMAJzornT0OdTxflU3Z0VR8MTUyMzMxOTA3MUAxNTIzMjMyNjcx)) as starting points. The sound effects are from [soundsnap.com](https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/fireworks).
